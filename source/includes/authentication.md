Unlock the Full Power of the Polymer API with API Keys!

To access our endpoints and unleash the potential of the Polymer API, you'll need API keys. Don't worry, we've made it easy for you to get started. Simply head over to the API Keys section in your user settings and register a new API key.

With Polymer, you have the flexibility to create multiple API keys and give them custom names. And if you no longer need a particular key, you can easily disable or remove it right from your dashboard.

To ensure seamless communication with the server, it's crucial to include the API key in all your requests. We provide two simple methods to include it:

Query Parameter Method:
Just append `?api_key=&your_api_key` to your request URL, where `your_api_key` is the API key you want to use.

Header Method:
Include the API key as a header in your request. Add `X-API-KEY: &your_api_key` to the headers, replacing `your_api_key` with your actual API key.

By following these guidelines, you'll have full access to the powerful features of the Polymer API. Get ready to elevate your applications to new heights!
