# Glossary

The Glossary section offers a comprehensive list of key terms, acronyms, and concepts used throughout the API documentation. It aims to clarify and define the technical language specific to the API, ensuring that you have a solid understanding of the terminology. By referencing the glossary, you can eliminate confusion and effectively communicate within the API context.

- API: Application Programming Interface. It defines the methods, protocols, and tools for building software applications and enables communication between different software systems.

- API Key: A unique identifier that is used to authenticate and authorize access to an API. It acts as a secret token that should be kept secure and used in API requests for authentication purposes.

- HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is the protocol used for transferring data over the web. HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted and provides a set of rules for communication between web servers and clients.

- JSON: JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is widely used for representing structured data in web APIs.

- REST: Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources.

- Endpoint: A specific URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that represents a resource or a collection of resources in the API. Endpoints define the available operations and the data format to interact with the API.

- Request: A client's message to the server, specifying the desired operation and any additional data or parameters. Requests are typically made using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.

- Response: The server's message sent back to the client in response to a request. It contains the requested data or an acknowledgment of the performed action.

- Authentication: The process of verifying the identity of a user or client application. It ensures that only authorized individuals or systems can access protected resources in the API. Common authentication mechanisms include API keys, tokens (such as JWT), and OAuth.

- Authorization: The process of granting or denying access to specific resources or operations based on the authenticated user's permissions. Authorization mechanisms control what actions a user can perform once they are authenticated.

- Payload: The data transmitted in a request or response body. In API terms, the payload usually consists of structured data in formats such as JSON or XML.

- Rate Limiting: A technique used to control the number of requests a client can make to the API within a specific time period. Rate limiting helps protect the server from abuse, ensures fair usage, and maintains overall system stability.

- Pagination: A technique for dividing large result sets into smaller, manageable chunks called pages. Pagination allows clients to retrieve data incrementally by specifying page numbers and limiting the number of items per page.

- Query Parameter: Additional parameters added to the API endpoint URL to modify the behavior of the request. Query parameters are often used for filtering, sorting, searching, or specifying additional options.

- Status Code: A three-digit number included in the HTTP response that indicates the status of the request. Common status codes include 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 400 (Bad Request), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error).
