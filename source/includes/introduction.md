# Introduction

Welcome to the PolymerSearch public API documentation! You can use our API to access PolymerSearch API endpoints, that provide various functionality present at our website.

Endpoints description, method, url, request/response shema and their description are presented on the left. The right side contains example requests (via curl) and reponses (in JSON). In the future, more endpoints will be added in order to provide complete access to PolymerSearch database.

If this is your first time reading the docs, check out the Authentication section for obtaining and using API keys.

Changelog section contains all updates related to this API.
