# Introduction

Welcome to the Polymer public API documentation!

The left side includes the endpoints description, method, URL, request/response schema, and description. The right side contains example requests (via curl) and responses (in JSON).

Most of the functionality available in the web application is covered by API. However, some use cases may not be available via API yet.

If this is your first time reading the docs, check out the Authentication section for obtaining and using API keys.
