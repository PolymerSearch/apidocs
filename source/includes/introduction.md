# Introduction

Welcome to the Polymer public API documentation! You can use our API to access Polymer API endpoints, that provide various functionality present on our website.

Endpoints description, method, URL, request/response schema, and their description are presented on the left. The right side contains example requests (via curl) and responses (in JSON). In the future, more endpoints will be added to provide complete access to Polymer database.

If this is your first time reading the docs, check out the Authentication section for obtaining and using API keys.

The Changelog section contains all updates related to this API.
