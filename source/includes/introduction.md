# Introduction

Welcome to the Polymer Public API documentation! Our API allows you to interact with Polymer's endpoints, providing access to various functionalities available on our platform.

On the left, you'll find detailed information about each endpoint, including descriptions, methods, URLs, and request/response schemas. The right side features example requests (via cURL) and corresponding JSON responses. We plan to expand this documentation with additional endpoints to offer comprehensive access to the Polymer database.

If this is your first time using our API, start by reviewing the Authentication section to learn how to obtain and use API keys.

For updates and changes, refer to the Changelog section.
